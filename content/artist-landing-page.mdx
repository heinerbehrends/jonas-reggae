Sierra Leonean born singer, songwriter and producer currently based in The Netherlands. 
He is a product of the generation that rendered havoc in that land. 
He chose his childhood dream of being a singer as a way to escape the chaos and instability. 
He founded the Earthian roots in the early nineties with friend from the ghetto. 
His inspirations are full of spirituality, reality and humanity. 
Peter Tosh is his mentor and idol. Due to the persistent warfare in Sierra Leone, he fled to Senegal where he had a brief spell in the Senegalese reggae scene. 
Destiny eventually took its toll and eventually went to France and finally settled in The Netherlands.
